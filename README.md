# Triglav

RnD project exploring in Scala:
- profunctor optics
- trifunctors
- modular approach to abstractions in category theory (bifunctors and profunctors)
- monoidal categories
- categories of profunctors
- 2-categories of type constructors
- toposes
- limits

This repo intends to create base for further research about: automatic code completition, optimization of functional proramms, generating FP libraries targetted for particular problem domain.
